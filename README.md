# cringe-gdi-with-bytebeat
any antivirus you have will detect this as a virus. its only bytebeat with gdi effects; dont close the command prompt windows until you want the gdi effects and sound to stop. run the bat files. (CommandScript GDI.bat and  playRandomSound.bat.) if the gdi still doesnt stop, use task manager to stop it. just search up 32 bit in task manager and then background processes to stop them. if it doesnt work, restart your PC. it makes the GDI forcefully stop.
